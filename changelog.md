# K-Search client changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/0.3.0/).

This project _do not adhere_ to Semantic Versioning. The `Major` version number 
indicates the supported K-Search API version, e.g. a version number `3` means that
the K-Search client supports K-Search api version `>=3.0`, but less than `4.0`.
